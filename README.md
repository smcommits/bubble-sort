# Bubble sort and bubble sort by algorithm

## Definition

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Explanation on how bubble sort works can be well illustrated by below gif image:

## About the Project

In this project we have implemented bubble sort and bubble sort by algorithms in the Ruby programming language. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Bubble Sort By algorithm is similar the bubble sort except the items are sorted based on the length of elements

## Project highlights

The algorithms are optimized based on two aspects of the bubble sort, first is the running the algorithm only until the list is swapped. We have achieved this using a boolean vairable for called 'switched' and second is reducing the number of elements on each iteration. We have achieved this by storing the length of the array in variable n and reducing the n by 1 at each iteration.
